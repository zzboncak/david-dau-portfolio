            <p>
              David saved the day for our daughter who was struggling in
              Precalculus. We reached out to him and his response was immediate
              and we set up a time that week. Loved his offer to meet in our
              home. Our daughter's grade was a C but she was able to get it up
              to an A in the next semester. I would give credit to David for
              instilling her confidence in math and helping her with greater
              understanding

            <p>
              Mr. Dau tutored me in my precalculus Honors class. I went from low
              Bs to high As on my exams. He walked through all my notes and
              explained everything I didn't understand.

            <p>
              I highly recommend David as a math tutor. He helped explain
              complicated concepts in a way my son understood and helped boost
              his confidence. He also came to our home and was flexible to
              accommodate my son's busy sports schedule.
