              <p>
                David saved the day for our daughter who was struggling in
                Precalculus. We reached out to him and his response was
                immediate and we set up a time that week. Loved his offer to
                meet in our home. Our daughter's grade was a C but she was able
                to get it up to an A in the next semester. I would give credit
                to David for instilling her confidence in math and helping her
                with greater understanding

                Mr. Dau tutored me in my precalculus Honors class. I went from
                low Bs to high As on my exams. He walked through all my notes
                and explained everything I didn't understand.

                I highly recommend David as a math tutor. He helped explain
                complicated concepts in a way my son understood and helped boost
                his confidence. He also came to our home and was flexible to
                accommodate my son's busy sports schedule.
